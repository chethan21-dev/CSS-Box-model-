The CSS Box Model - 

Here in CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.

The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins. The image below illustrates the box model:

Explanation of the different parts:

1. Content - 
The content of the box, where text and images appear
2. Padding - 
Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
3. Border - 
A border that goes around the padding and content
4. Margin - 
Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 
Example : 
Demonstration of the box model:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div {
  background-color: lightgrey;
  width: 300px;
  border: 15px solid green;
  padding: 50px;
  margin: 20px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Demonstrating the Box Model</h2>
<p>The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. 
It consists of: borders, padding, margins, and the actual content.</p>
<div>Text 1 the content of the box. We have added a 50px padding, 20px margin and a 15px green border. And Here after what ever the text is taken in inside. These text taken places</div>
</body>
</html>

1. Width and Height of an Element 
2. In order to set the width and height of an element correctly in all browsers, you need to know how the box model works.
Important: When you set the width and height properties of an element with CSS, you just set the width and height of the content area. To calculate the total width and height of an element, you must also include the padding and borders.

Here another one example to calculate total height : 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
div {
  width: 320px;
  height: 50px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid gray;
  margin: 0;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Calculate the total width:</h2>
<img src="C:\Users\lenovo\Downloads\HTML Sample Projects\CSS Box model\White1.jpeg" width="350" height="263" alt="White background image">
<div>The picture above is 350px wide. The total width of this element is also 350px. The total height of this element is 80px.</div>
</body>
</html>
